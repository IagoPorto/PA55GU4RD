# \<PA55GU4RD\>

\*\*\*\* WORK IN PROGRESS \*\*\*\*

\<PA55GU4RD\> is a way to store your passwords securely. Users and passwords are stored hashed and passwords are stored with symmetric encryption using the AES-256 algorithm.

## 1. How to use?
**First of all, \<PA55GU4RD\>, is a program still under development. There are bugs and missing functionality.**
   + Execute the main.py file (available in the backend folder)
     
      ```shell
      python main.py
      ```
   + Create a new user and a new password.
   + Now you can create a random password and save it securely for future reference.
      + You need to use a 32-character password to encrypt your other passwords, which will not be stored anywhere, and only you can know it.
   + You can change and delete the passwords. 

## 2. What will be in the future?
   + DB
   + Invisible passwords. You will be able to copy the password without it being displayed on the screen.
   + User manager. Now only one user is allowed, but in the future it will be possible to have more.
   + Frontend
      + Android application
      + Linux/Windows application
   + Secure conection between backend and frontend.
      + Asymmetric encryption using RSA algorithm
      + JWT
      + HTTPS
      + Â¿WireGuard?
